== Closest Fibonacci
   This gem adds instance method closest_fibonacci to Fixnum class. This results in an object of Fixnum when sent closest_fibonacci message to output the maximum fibonacci number less than or equal to that object.
    note: if fixnum object is a non-positive integer then closest_fibonacci is designed to return nil.
    example: puts 2.closes_fibonacci ==> 1
